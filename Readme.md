## About

React-Shopping was created to demonstrate capabilities with React, Redux, Typescript & Tailwind CSS to create a template for a frontend client for an e-commerce application.

This template uses a minamalist design to present a clean UI for the user. The user interface is both responsive and reactive allowing for an enhanced user experience.

## Technology Features

- Redux has been used for state management allowing users to add items into their cart.
- Tailwind CSS has been used for all components, allowing for custom css with a small bundle size.
- Vite has been used to optimize the production build and developer experience with fast build times.
- Deployment has been achieved to Github Pages using a Github workflow.

## Summary

The app presents a front end user interface that can be extended to create a full stack e-commerce application. The app explores front end technologies and is not intended to be a full stack application. Its function is intended more as a template or starting point for a full stack e-commerce application.
